    "### Breaking down the code step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "initialize_board(): This function creates and initializes the game board, a 3x3 grid, with all spaces empty (' ').\n",
    "\n",
    "print_board(board): This function prints the current state of the game board. Each cell of the board is displayed, separated by vertical bars, making it visually clear for the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "check_win(board, player): Checks if the specified player ('X' for human or 'O' for AI) has won. It checks all rows, columns, and the two diagonals to see if any line contains the same player's symbol exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "check_draw(board): Determines if the game has ended in a draw, which occurs when all cells are filled and there is no winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "alphabeta(board, depth, alpha, beta, is_maximizing): This is the key function that implements the Alpha-Beta pruning technique within the minimax framework. It evaluates the game board and decides the optimal move:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Cases: Return a score if the game reaches a terminal state (win, loss, or draw).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Case for Maximizing Player (AI): It tries to maximize the score. The function iterates through possible moves, recursively calling itself to explore deeper into the game tree and updating the alpha value. It prunes the branches where it is guaranteed not to find a better move than already evaluated (beta <= alpha).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Case for Minimizing Player (Human): It tries to minimize the score, similar to the maximizing scenario, but updates the beta value and prunes using the same condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "best_move_ab(board): Determines the best move for the AI using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm. It iterates over all possible moves, computes the score for each using the alphabeta function, and selects the move with the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "main(): This function controls the flow of the game:\n",
    "Initializes the board and sets the human player to start,\n",
    "Continues the game in a loop, alternating turns between the human and AI until the game is won or drawn,\n",
    "Human moves are input through the console and validated for correctness (e.g., checking if the selected cell is empty and within the valid range),\n",
    "AI moves are determined by the best_move_ab function,\n",
    "After each move, the board is checked for a win or a draw, If the game is over, the result is printed and the loop exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script provides a complete console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human plays against an AI that calculates its moves based on the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm, leading to more efficient decision-making compared to the basic minimax approach."
